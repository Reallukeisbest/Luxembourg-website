                Luxembourg uses a constitutional monarchy with hereditary. This means that the grand duke, has the power to appoint the prime minister. Despite this advantage, the grand duke’s powers are primarily formal. Most of the power goes to the prime minister
                and their ministerial council or cabinet. The reason for this is that they are responsible for the Chamber of Deputies. The members of this are elected to five year terms.

                When Europe was fighting, in 1555, Luxembourg was able to stay away from the war from 1618–48, but in 1635, France got involved. France slowly started to capture Luxembourg in 1679 and by 1684, France captured Luxembourg city, which completed their capture
                of Luxembourg. In 1697, however, France gave Luxembourg back to Spain under the terms of the Treaties of Rijswijk.
